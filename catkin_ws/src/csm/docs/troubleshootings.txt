### Usage of `-ffast-math` ###

Use of `-ffast-math` is ok for computations. However, output routines do not work as expected. In particular, invalid JSON is generated, because it can't distinguish `NaN` values.

To make sure that it's all ok, there is a test program called `test_math_utils_sanity` that checks for good behaviour with NaN values.
